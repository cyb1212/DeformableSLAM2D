# This is a code for 2D deformable SLAM framework.
This code is related to the IROS 2021 acceptted paper: Shoudong Huang, Yongbo Chen, Liang Zhao, Yanhao Zhang, and Mengya Xu, Some Research Questions for SLAM in Deformable Environments, 2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2021). 
A related additional simulation about the active SLAM in deformable environment is shown in https://github.com/MengyaXu/2D-active-deformable-SLAM
